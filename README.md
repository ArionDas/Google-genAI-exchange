The platform architecture integrates AI-powered questioning with multimodal learning, real-time visualization, and performance tracking tools.

### Key Components:
1. **AI Chat Assistant**: Engages students with Socratic questioning to promote problem-solving and deeper understanding.
2. **Multimodal Learning Support**:
   - Image-Based Queries
   - Video Summarization
   - Text-Based Doubt Resolution
3. **Interactive Visualization Tools**: Enables real-time visualizations for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
4. **Integrated Code Editor**: An environment for coding, testing, and debugging in real-time.
5. **Self-Evaluation Tools**: Customizable tests to focus on weak areas.
6. **Activity Tracking and Heatmap**: Provides insights into student engagement and progress.
7. **Gamified Learning**: Motivational badges to encourage learning milestones.
8. **Motivational AI Assistant**: Delivers daily motivational quotes to inspire students.

- **Motivational AI Assistant**: Daily motivational quotes to keep students inspired.

## Out of Scope
- **Accuracy of Information**: Responses are based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and may not be 100% accurate. Users should verify important information independently.

## Future Opportunities
1. **Collaborative Learning Features**: Add forums, study groups, and peer-to-peer interaction tools.
2. **Integration with External Educational Platforms**: Partner with established educational platforms for high-quality courses.
3. **Live Certified Courses**: Provide live certified courses and expert-led learning opportunities.
