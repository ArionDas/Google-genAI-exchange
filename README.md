![Features](https://github.com/ArionDas/Google-genAI-exchange/blob/bb4c6ca1407283041541b79bab09e16bf32e461f/visuals/desk.jpg)
## Project Overview
Socratic Learning is an AI-powered educational platform designed to revolutionize learning through the Socratic method. The platform engages students with thought-provoking questions, promotes critical thinking, and provides a comprehensive learning environment using multimodal support, interactive tools, and personalized paths for continuous learning.

## Architecture

The platform architecture integrates AI-powered questioning with multimodal learning, real-time visualization, and performance tracking tools.

### Key Components:
1. **`AI Chat Assistant`**: Engages students with Socratic questioning to promote problem-solving and deeper understanding.
2. **`Multimodal Learning Support`**:
   - Image-Based Queries
   - Video Summarization
   - Text-Based Doubt Resolution
3. **`Interactive Visualization Tools`**: Enables real-time visualizations for Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA).
4. **`Integrated Code Editor`**: An environment for coding, testing, and debugging in real-time.
5. **`Self-Evaluation Tools`**: Customizable tests to focus on weak areas.
6. **`Activity Tracking and Heatmap`**: Provides insights into student engagement and progress.
7. **Gamified Learning**: Motivational badges to encourage learning milestones.
8. **`Motivational AI Assistant`**: Delivers daily motivational quotes to inspire students.

## In-Scope Features
- **`AI Chat Assistant`**: Engages students through the Socratic method, enhancing critical thinking.
- **`Multimodal Learning Support`**:
  - Image-Based Queries: Upload diagrams, code screenshots, etc., to ask questions.
  - Video Summarization: Summarize and clarify doubts at specific timestamps.
  - Text-Based Doubt Resolution: Ask questions directly in text format.
- **`Interactive Visualization Tools`**: Real-time visualizations of DSA operations like sorting, searching, and traversals.
- **`Resource Suggestion Engine`**: Suggests curated articles, videos, and personalized learning paths.
- **`Integrated Code Editor`**: Write, test, and debug code with real-time feedback.
- **`Self-Evaluation Tools`**: Generate customizable tests with adjustable difficulty levels.
- **`Activity Tracking and Heatmap`**: Visualize engagement and monitor study habits.
- **`Gamified Learning with Achievement Badges`**: Earn motivational badges to track learning progress:
  


- **`Motivational AI Assistant`**: Daily motivational quotes to keep students inspired.

## Out of Scope
- **`Accuracy of Information`**: Responses are based on Large Language Models (LLMs) and may not be 100% accurate. Users should verify important information independently.

## Future Opportunities
1. **`Collaborative Learning Features`**: Add forums, study groups, and peer-to-peer interaction tools.
2. **`Integration with External Educational Platforms`**: Partner with established educational platforms for high-quality courses.
3. **`Live Certified Courses`**: Provide live certified courses and expert-led learning opportunities.
